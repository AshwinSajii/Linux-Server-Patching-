# Linux Server Manual Patching – Project

## Project Definition
This project demonstrates **manual Linux server patching** using a **production-style approach**.  
It follows real enterprise practices such as **pre-checks, controlled patching, post-validation, and logging**.

A detailed **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** is maintained separately.  
This repository focuses on **structure, execution artifacts, and evidence**.
